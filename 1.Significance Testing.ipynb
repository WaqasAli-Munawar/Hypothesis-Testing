This type of study is called a blind experiment since the participants didn't know which pill they were receiving. This helps us reduce the potential bias that is introduced when participants know which pill they were given. For example, participants who are aware they were given the weight loss pill may try to add healthier foods to their diet to help them lose more weight. Both groups were weighed before the study began and a month later, after the study ended."

    "Understanding the **research design** for a study is an important first step that informs the rest of our analysis. It helps us uncover potential flaws in the study that we need to keep in mind as we dive deeper. The weight loss pill study we conducted is known as an **experimental study**. Experimental studies usually involve bringing in participants, instructing them to perform some tasks, and observing them. A key part of running an experimental study is random assignment, which involves assigning participants in the study to random groups without revealing which group each participant is in. Before exploring and analyzing a dataset, it's important to understand how the study was conducted. Flaws in how the study was run can lead us to reach the wrong conclusions."

    "The **permutation test** is a statistical test that involves simulating rerunning the study many times and recalculating the test statistic for each iteration. The goal is to calculate a distribution of the test statistics over these many iterations. This distribution is called the **sampling distribution** and it approximates the full range of possible test statistics under the null hypothesis. We can then benchmark the test statistic we observed in the data (a mean difference of 2.52) to determine how likely it is to observe this mean difference under the null hypothesis. If the null hypothesis is true, that the weight loss pill doesn't help people lose more weight, than the observed mean difference of 2.52 should be quite common in the sampling distribution. If it's instead extremely rare, then we accept the alternative hypothesis instead"
